# btn100-ontology
This repository contains the files generated for the development of the btn100 ontology. This ontology aims to represent the Spanish Topographic Base (1:100.000 scale) from the [Spanish Institute for Geographic Information](http://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal). 

The ontology file is provided as [btn100.owl](https://github.com/oeg-upm/ontology-BTN100/blob/master/btn100.owl) and it is published at [https://datos.ign.es/def/btn100](https://datos.ign.es/def/btn100). In addition, the geo-core ontology file, which represents geographic objects and is used as the core of the btn100 ontology, is provided as [geo_core.owl](https://github.com/oeg-upm/ontology-BTN100/blob/master/geo_core.owl) and it is published at [https://datos.ign.es/def/geo_core](https://datos.ign.es/def/geo_core).

- OnToology contains the ontology documentation files for btn100 and geo-core.
- Diagrams contains the diagrams for the ontologies and the skos thesauri.
